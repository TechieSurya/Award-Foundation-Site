            to the community is an essential part of the
            Dharsana Foundation's mission. Dharsana's
            commitment to giving has been
            demonstrated through its 5+ years of
            supporting and rewarding students. We are
            now expanding in giving and have become a
            registered Foundation, so we can support
            even more people and causes as we go
            forward.
            <br><br>
            More than 2000 individuals have been
            recognized for their deprived status, then
            given hope, and support, and they excelled
            in their careers.
            <br><br>
            As part of this tradition, a number of events
            are held every year in order to collect funds
            for deserving students and youths. These
            events are held so that they can be
            recognized and encouraged for their efforts.
